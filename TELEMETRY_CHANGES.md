# Telemetry System Changes Summary

## What Changed

The Langflow telemetry system has been modified to **log telemetry data locally** instead of sending it to the external service at `https://langflow.gateway.scarf.sh`.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/backend/base/langflow/services/telemetry/service.py`
- **Removed**: HTTP client initialization and external API calls
- **Added**: Local logging with structured format
- **Added**: Placeholder comments for future analytics integrations
- **Maintained**: All existing payload collection and privacy controls

## Current Behavior

### Before
```
[Network Request] POST https://langflow.gateway.scarf.sh/run
Body: {"runSeconds": 45, "runSuccess": true, ...}
```

### After
```
[INFO] [TELEMETRY] Endpoint: run
[INFO] [TELEMETRY] Payload: {"runSeconds": 45, "runSuccess": true, ...}
```

## Benefits

1. **Privacy**: No external data transmission
2. **Debugging**: Easier to monitor and troubleshoot
3. **Flexibility**: Foundation for custom analytics integrations
4. **Performance**: Removed network dependency and potential failures

## Privacy Controls (Unchanged)

- `DO_NOT_TRACK=true` environment variable disables all telemetry
- `do_not_track=true` setting disables all telemetry
- `prometheus_enabled=false` disables OpenTelemetry metrics

## Future Integration

The system is now ready for easy integration with:
- Google Analytics 4
- Mixpanel
- Amplitude
- Custom analytics endpoints
- Business intelligence platforms

See `docs/TELEMETRY.md` for detailed integration examples and implementation guide.

## Testing

All existing telemetry functionality remains intact - the only change is the destination of the data (logs instead of external service).

To verify the changes:
1. Run Langflow with telemetry enabled
2. Perform actions (create flows, run components, etc.)
3. Check logs for `[TELEMETRY]` entries
4. Verify no external network requests to scarf.sh

## Rollback

If needed, the previous behavior can be restored by reverting the changes to `service.py` and re-adding the HTTP client code.
